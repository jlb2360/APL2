# APL2

APL2, A Programming Language 2.0, is a simple scripting language written in go.

Currently this is only a transpiler with a very simple implemenetation. I hope to add things in the future as I need them.

This is not and will never be a production ready language. This is simply a portfolio project that I thought would be fun.

## ToDo
1. Add Floats
2. Add a mut keyword to be able to change variables
3. Add a for keyword to implement a for loop
